Simple python script that generates Sqlite3 insert statements from a colon delimited text file.

For this script to work, the text file must not contain any double quotes ("").

USAGE: python create_inserts.py input.txt output.Sqlite3

In the program, you will be prompted to enter a table name, the number of columns and the column names. The rest of the insert statements
will be generated by the script.

If you want to change the delimiter that the script parses on, it is a simple change on line 22.
